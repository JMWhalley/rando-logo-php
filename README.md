# rando-logo-php
A PHP code that I had used to change the logo colors on page refresh/change on a website. 

This code works for WordPress. 
Place this code in the header.php of your WordPress theme above the logo code section of your theme. Use of a child theme is suggested for this code. 

This code has both a desktop and mobile classes for the logos. Both can be styled with CSS using .desktop-logo and .mobile-logo repectively. 

change ' '; for the url of every color variant of the logo you have. 

change href=" " for the URL that you want your logo to point to eg. your homepage. 

Thank you for looking at my code.
